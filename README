18-447 Lab 1, Spring 2013.  

For this lab, you will be writing a functional simulator of a subset of MIPS.
Please see the lab handout for details.


/*** Files ***/

1. "src/" subdirectory 
- The shell: "shell.h", "shell.c" (DO NOT MODIFY)
- The simulator skeleton: "sim.c" (MODIFY)

2. "inputs/" subdirectory 
- Test inputs for the simulator (MIPS assembly code): "*.s"
- MIPS assembler/hexdump (assembly code -> machine code -> hexdump): "asm2hex"


/*** Instructions ***/

1. Modify "sim.c" to implement the MIPS instruction set specified in the lab
handout. Run "make" to compile the simulator.

$ cd src/
$ make

You should now have an executable file named "sim".


2. Use "asm2hex" to convert the test inputs ("*.s") into hexdumps of assembled
machine code ("*.x").

$ cd inputs/
$ ./asm2hex addiu.s

You should now have a hexdump of the assembled machine code "addiu.x". Repeat
this step for the rest of the test inputs.


3. Run the hexdump in the simulator.

$ src/sim inputs/addiu.x

>> Read 7 words from program into memory.

Right now, the simulator will become unresponsive because it has not been
implemented yet (that is your job!). Press Control+C to exit the simulator.
